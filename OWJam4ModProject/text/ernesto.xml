			<Page>Welcome to the admin zone of the simulation! Take a look around and you might find some useful tools.</Page>
			<Page>This is the end of the mod (so we're allowed to talk now). We hope you had fun!</Page>
			<Page>But I know what you're here for: the obligatory Ernesto easter egg.</Page>
			<Page>Well I'm a bit tired of being an easter egg, so I thought I'd give my husband Geswaldo The Magic Talking Jellyfish a turn.</Page>
			<Page>He's hidden somwhere in the simulation. There might be a clue around here somewhere. Have fun finding him!</Page>
